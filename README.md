In ancient China, there was a well-known parable called “Blind Men and the Elephant.”

It tells the story of several blind men who had never seen an elephant before. One day, an elephant came to their village, and out of curiosity, they took turns touching it to figure out what it was like.

The man who touched the leg said,
“An elephant is like a thick pillar!”

The man who touched the ear disagreed,
“No, an elephant is like a large fan!”

The man who touched the tail insisted,
“You’re all wrong. An elephant is like a thin rope!”

The man who touched the trunk argued back,
“Nonsense. It’s clearly like a long, heavy hose!”

They kept arguing, each firmly believing he was right, without realizing that each of them had touched only one part of the elephant—never understanding the whole.

Yet at the same time, each of them did touch a real part of the elephant.

This is similar to the specialized robots we have today: each excels in one particular capability—radar, vision, electromagnetic sensing, or various forms of perception such as light, temperature, humidity, gravity, sound, pressure, or magnetism. But unlike humans, they do not possess smell, taste, hearing, vision, and touch all at once, nor can they integrate multiple sensory dimensions simultaneously to understand the full “truth” of a situation. In this sense, every specialized AI system, compared with humans, is essentially “like a blind man touching the elephant.”

As technology continues to advance, the AI ecosystem will only grow larger and more complex. Communication between AI systems will become inevitable. Therefore, I believe that dialogue between AI machines is a crucial topic we must study.

It is like a glass of water:

one AI may know that it flows,

another knows it is cool,

another knows its volume,

another knows its weight,

another sees that it is transparent,

and yet another understands most of its properties—but not all of them.

If these AIs could truly communicate and share what they know, they would easily recognize that this is a glass of water.

This may seem similar to an AI machine that uses multiple specialized chips internally, but there is a fundamental difference. What we aim to achieve is communication at the level of individual AI units. Each AI may have a different purpose, architecture, or system design. The goal is to enable these independent AIs—each functioning as a complete entity—to communicate with one another and make true “dialogue” between them possible.
